# Usage instructions
usage_instructions = """
USAGE INSTRUCTIONS FOR CORRECTED IMPLEMENTATION:

1. INSTALL DEPENDENCIES:
   pip install ortools torch networkx matplotlib scipy numpy

2. RUN THE CORRECTED DEMO:
   python corrected_floor_plan_demo.py

3. KEY IMPROVEMENTS MADE:

   A) BOUNDARY ENFORCEMENT:
   - CP-SAT constraints ensure rooms stay within building boundary
   - Boundary validation in constraint projection
   - Coordinate system properly aligned

   B) ADJACENCY HANDLING:
   - Strong adjacency constraints (weight > 0.7) enforced in CP-SAT
   - Adjacency enforcement in iterative refinement
   - Priority-based room positioning

   C) SEMANTIC IMPROVEMENTS:
   - Room type influences placement priority
   - Bathroom placement near edges
   - Living room gets central positioning preference
   - Area constraints strictly enforced

   D) CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION:
   - OR-Tools CP-SAT for optimal room placement
   - Multi-objective optimization (area, adjacency, compactness)
   - Fallback algorithms for infeasible cases

   E) QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
   - Comprehensive layout quality scoring
   - Detailed validation with specific issue reporting
   - Adjacency satisfaction tracking

4. EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:
   - Rooms will respect building boundaries
   - High-weight adjacencies will be satisfied
   - No overlapping rooms
   - Better area utilization
   - More architecturally sensible layouts

5. METHOD NAMING FIXED:
   - generate_walls() method now exists (was wall_generator)
   - All method calls match implementation
